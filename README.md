### Assignment: 
Build a rudimentary censoring tool that looks for a word passed on with the GET method and, if present in a predetermined text, edits it out and prints three asterisks instead.
Print all the relevant data (original string, word to be censored, etc. + the length of the original string.

### Goals: 
Get a first taste of plain PHP coding.
